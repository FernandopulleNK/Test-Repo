      In order to use them properly, you’ll need to understand their electromagnetic characteristics and how they change during use. After you’ve got a handle on the theory behind ferrite bead uses, you can deliberately select one for your PCB in instances where they are needed. Incorrect selection of these components can create more problems than they fix due to creation of radiated EMI or limiting of channel bandwidth (or both), which will prevent power or signal from reaching a load.
